# Voice Agent Hackathon Template

Welcome to the Voice Agent Hackathon! This template contains a ready-to-use voice agent built with [AssemblyAI](https://assemblyai.com) and [Rime](https://rime.ai). All you need to run it is a [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io) project.

This starter app is compatible with any [custom web/mobile frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/) or [SIP-based telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/).

## Setup

Step 1: Copy this repository (Click the green "Use this template" button on GitHub)
Step 2: Clone your new copy to your local machine
Step 3: Install dependencies using uv

```console
cd voice-agent-hackathon
uv sync
```

Step 4: Set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required values from your [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io) project

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk app env -w .env.local
```

## Run the agent

Before your first run, you must download certain models such as [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/):

```console
uv run python src/agent.py download-files
```

Next, run this command to speak to your agent directly in your terminal:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

## Web playground

## Web frontend

This agent is compatible with the [LiveKit Agents Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io). 

To run the agent for the playground, use the `dev` subcomand:

    ```shell
    uv run agent.py dev
    ```

## Custom frontend & telephony

Get started quickly with our pre-built frontend starter apps, or add telephony support:

For advanced customization, see the [complete frontend guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/).

## Tests and evals

This project includes a complete suite of evals, based on the LiveKit Agents [testing & evaluation framework](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/). To run them, use `pytest`.

```console
uv run pytest
```

To run the tests in a CI environment, you must also [add repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-secrets-in-github-actions) for `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`.

## Deploying to production

This project is production-ready and includes a working `Dockerfile`. To deploy it to LiveKit Cloud or another environment, see the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ops/deployment/) guide.
